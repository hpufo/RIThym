Stores pratice locations and times in a database and display them on a google map. People are free to add locations to the database. 

Purpose:
The function on this project is to display user added practice locations for activities like Break dancing, parkour, etc. 

Use:
Anyone can add or edit a location, but only the admin will be able to delete a location.

Roadmap:
This is a work in process. I will be adding several things to this project. I won't be working on these in any praticular order.

Short term:
finish the edit/update feature
some CSS

Long term:
Admin login
List of locations that are flagged for deletion including the user added reason
The ability to delete pratice locations

Once the main app is done I'll add these features:
A search for locations
Adding events(Compitions)
A calender displaying all the upcoming events
Maybe show these events on the maps
